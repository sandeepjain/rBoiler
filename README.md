#rBoiler: Responsive HTML5 Boilerplate

rBoiler is boilerplate for developer's designing responsive sites. 

It extends [HTML5 Boilerplate][] by including  [Golden Grid System][].

[Golden Grid System]: http://goldengridsystem.com/ "Grid system for responsive design"

As GGS is based on 'leave IE behind' principle, I have not include any poly-fill for media queries. But you can go ahead and easily include [Respond JS][] or anyother poly-fill for IE6-8.
